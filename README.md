In this challenge I added semantic tags to the html body, consolided CSS rules in style cards and corrected a faulty link in the navigation bars. I also added alt tags to image elements and changed the title to the page.

Resourses used to complete this challenge included included consulting W# schools website, freecampcode.org, using in class exercises as reference.
